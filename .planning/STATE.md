# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-20 after v2.0 scope realignment)

**Core value:** A non-technical business owner can describe their problem and end up with a deployed, secure, proactive agent team without writing code and without improvised security scaffolding.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Designer + Deploy — roadmap locked (Phases 8-16). Ready for `/gsd-discuss-phase 8` once planning cycle resumes.
**Scope source:** `.planning/v2.0-PROMPT.pdf` (authoritative).

## Current Position

Phase: 8 (Business Graph Foundation) — Plans 1 and 2 complete. Phase 8 ready for verification.
Plan: Phase 9 Plan 01 (next — `/gsd-discuss-phase 9`)
Status: 08-02 SUMMARY committed. phase-1-interview.md extended (350 -> 388 lines) with Category 7 decision_patterns seed, Summary-gate Business Graph tables, Business Graph Emission subsection. SKILL.md extended (159 -> 163 lines) with unconditional business-graph-schema.md load, business_graph_validated sub-gate in State Transitions, Phase 2 precondition. INTV-01..04 marked complete.
Last activity: 2026-04-21 — Commits 862241b (phase-1-interview) + 0ffbcda (SKILL.md). Phase 8 plans 1-2 complete; INTV-01..04 + BGRAPH-01..04 all satisfied.

Progress: [##————————] 8% (2/25 v2.0 plans complete, 0/9 phases complete)

## v2.0 Milestone — Phase Structure (realigned 2026-04-20)

|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| 8 | Business Graph Foundation | 2 | INTV-01..04, BGRAPH-01..04 (8) |
| 9 | Designer Agent | 3 | DSGN-01..07, ORCH-01..04 (11) |
| 10 | Integration Discovery — MCP Path | 3 | INTEG-01..06 (6) |
| 11 | Integration Discovery — Browser Fallback | 3-4 | BROWSER-01..12 (12) |
| 12 | Deploy Pipeline + Agent Memory | 3 | DEPLOY-01..08, MEM-01..06 (14) |
| 13 | Multi-Agent Runtime | 2-3 | RUNTIME-01..07 (7) |

| 16 | End-to-End Validation and Release | 2 | cross-cutting (Arco Rooms E2E, TAP, CHANGELOG, tag v2.0.0) |

Coverage: **79/79 requirements** mapped across 13 categories. Dependency chain load-bearing: 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → (9 → 15) → 16.

## Scope Pivot History (v2.0)

- **2026-04-18 (initial)**: Kicked off as "Discovery Agent — autonomous reverse engineering of web portals + API endpoints when no MCP exists." 4 parallel research agents produced STACK / FEATURES / ARCHITECTURE / PITFALLS + SUMMARY. Committed 46 requirements, 8 phases.
- **2026-04-20 (realignment)**: `.planning/v2.0-PROMPT.pdf` re-anchored v2.0 as **"Designer + Deploy"** — full auto-design + deployment pipeline with proactive anticipation. Prior Discovery Agent work retained as BROWSER-xx category (Integration Discovery Step 4 fallback, Phase 11 of the new roadmap). Research files in `.planning/research/` remain valid for that sub-phase.

## Published Artifacts

| Location | Content |
|----------|---------|
| Local `master` branch | Full phase-by-phase history with original Arco Rooms identifiers (private) |
| Local `main` branch | Single orphan commit matching remote (anonymized) |
| Remote `pablodelarco/agentbloc` | Single commit `9c74c9e feat: AgentBloc v1.0` (anonymized) |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table. Summary of v1.0 outcomes:
- Security promoted to Phase 2 — all user-facing phases correctly depend on security framework (✓ good)
- Skill-only v1.0 (no custom runtime) — shipped, awaiting market validation
- Gate enforcement via `[PHASE: N | GATE: X]` — structural ritual works modulo runtime behaviors requiring live testing
- Publish strategy (`main` anonymized orphan, `master` private full history) — clean separation holds

v2.0 scope decisions (2026-04-20):
- Authoritative scope = `.planning/v2.0-PROMPT.pdf`. PROJECT.md / REQUIREMENTS.md / ROADMAP.md rewritten to match.
- Stack pivot: AgentBloc remains markdown skill but runs INSIDE ClaudeClaw (TypeScript + Bun platform). No custom runtime added to AgentBloc itself.
- Event bus: n8n for real-time webhooks (existing infrastructure). Cron for scheduled work.
- Framework pattern inheritance (not dependency adoption): CrewAI / AG2 / ADK / LangGraph / Mastra / Paperclip. Each pattern cited with rationale in `v2.0-PROMPT.pdf`.
- Anticipation Engine is the differentiator — no other framework analyzed (CrewAI / LangGraph / AG2 / ADK / Paperclip) suggests unrequested agents.
- Prior "Discovery Agent" scope subordinated to BROWSER-xx category (Phase 11). 2026-04-18 research still applies.

### Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at v1.0 milestone close on 2026-04-18:

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| verification | Phase 01 — 01-VERIFICATION.md | human_needed (3 runtime behaviors: skill activation via description, language auto-detection, technical-level inference — design correct, runtime behavior untestable statically) |
| verification | Phase 05 — 05-VERIFICATION.md | gaps_found (resolved during audit; informational-only items remain per `v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` resolved_during_audit section) |

### Blockers / Carry-Forward

- [Research]: Activation rate benchmarking methodology undefined; needed if future milestone adds live-replay testing of skill activation
- [Research]: Spanish glossary needs native-speaker review
- [User action]: SECURITY.md uses placeholder email `security@agentbloc.dev` — replace with real address
- [Optional]: Tag v1.0.0 release on GitHub once happy (`gh release create v1.0.0`)
- [v2.0 Phase 8 discuss]: Open decisions from prior (pre-pivot) REQUIREMENTS.md — (a) DISCOVERY-REPORT.md split threshold at >30 endpoints (v2.0 single-file default, applies to Phase 11 BROWSER-xx); (b) OPT_IN_LEDGER.json scope (per-project default, applies to Phase 11 BROWSER-03)
- [v2.0 Phase 9 discuss]: Designer Agent topology selection heuristics (when to pick pipeline vs mesh vs hierarchy vs swarm — currently documented as qualitative; may need concrete decision matrix)
- [v2.0 Phase 13 discuss]: n8n webhook → ClaudeClaw job contract (payload shape, ID propagation, failure handling) — needs live test against existing n8n deployment
- [v2.0 Phase 15 discuss]: Anticipation heuristics evidence requirement (three independent sources per mapping) — defines rigor bar, may slow the first heuristics doc
- [v2.0 prep]: ClaudeClaw API surface — verify `Agent` / `TeamCreate` / `SendMessage` / Jobs signatures concretely before Phase 13 plans
- [v2.0 prep]: OpenClaw substrate (deferred to v3.0) — investigate during v3.0 kickoff
- [v2.0 prep]: oh-my-claudecode learner system pattern — review `.omc/skills/` auto-extraction before designing v4.0 Self-Healing

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-21T12:00:00.000Z
Stopped at: Phase 8 Plan 2 complete. phase-1-interview.md + SKILL.md wired. SUMMARY committed. Phase 8 ready for verification.
Next: `/gsd-verify-phase 8` to run the ROADMAP Phase 8 success criteria end-to-end. Then `/gsd-discuss-phase 9` to begin Designer Agent planning (consumes the Business Graph emitted by Phase 1, produces agent-profiles.yaml).
